# 🛡 AES File Encryption Tool 🛡

Hey, fellow outlaws! 😎 In this repository, we've got a nifty little Rust program that encrypts and decrypts files using the AES-256 algorithm in CBC mode. Looking to keep your files safe from those prying eyes 👀 or just geeking out with some crypto in Rust? You've struck gold! 🚀

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the Outlaw Repository:**  
   First things first, clone this treasure trove to your local machine.

   git clone https://github.com/tomasmedellin/aes_file_encryption.git
   ```

2. **Venture into the Directory:**  
   Move to the heart of the project.
   ```bash
   cd aes_file_encryption
   ```

3. **Compile with Cargo:**  
   Summon Rust's trusty sidekick, Cargo, to compile the code.
   ```bash

   ```

## 🚀 Running the Program

Once you've prepared your arsenal, launch the program using:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

Follow the on-screen cues 🖥 to either encrypt or decrypt a file. Guard your encryption key 🔑 and initialization vector with your life, you'll need them for the decryption ritual!
